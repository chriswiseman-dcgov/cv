Schema Release Notes - 2016.04.07
-----------------------------------

common.xsd:

  - The documentation for the DateRangeType has been updated to clarify
    the usage and precision of the type

  - A new type, DateTimeRangeType, has been added to allow time ranges

organization.xsd:

  - For the purposes of clarity, the following types have been renamed:
    + PartnerEmployerChangedServiceEventType -> EmployerEventType
    + EmployerDigestCarrierNotificationEventNameType -> EmployerDigestEventNameType
    + PartnerEmployerChangedServiceEventListType -> EmployerServiceEventListType
    + EmployerUpdateCarrierDigestEventBodyType -> EmployerDigestServiceEventBodyType
    + EmployerUpdateDigestCarrierNotificationEventType -> EmployerDigestEventType

  - To reduce confusion on usage, the following elements have been renamed:
    + employer_digest (root element) -> employer_digest_event : This now communicates
      the usage of this element as a root event type, which may occur by itself and
      denotes a transmitted event
    + employer_digest (in the context of a digest event) -> employer_events :
      This rename reduces confusion and indicates the purpose of the event being to
      act as a container for multiple employer events.
    + employer_change -> employer_event

  - The base EmployerEvent type has been extended to allow multiple ways to reference
    the resource contained in the event

  - Documentation for the following structures has been updated:
    + employer_digest_event element
    + EmployerOrganizationType type
